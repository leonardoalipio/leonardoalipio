# Welcome to my repository!

- 🔭 I'm a full-stack developer focused on the .NET ecosystem. I build robust web applications using ASP.NET Core MVC, WebApi, and C#, aiming for clean, predictable, and maintainable code. 
- 🌱 Right now I'm learning React.js + TypeScript, and preparing to dive into GraphQL and gRPC, since REST works — but some systems demand more flexibility.
- 💬 I like breaking down problems and assembling solutions that are simple, objective, and functional.
