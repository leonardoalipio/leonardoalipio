# Welcome to my repository!

-  I'm a full-stack developer focused on the .NET ecosystem. I build robust web applications using ASP.NET Core MVC, WebApi, and C#, aiming for clean, predictable, and maintainable code. 
-  Right now I'm learning React.js + TypeScript, and preparing to dive into GraphQL and gRPC, since REST works — but some systems demand more flexibility.
-  I like breaking down problems and assembling solutions that are simple, objective, and functional.
